## What is Jenkins ?  
Jenkins is an open source implementation of a CI server written in Java that can be used as a self-hosted option automating the build cycle for any project. It works with any programming language and for multiple platforms including Windows, Linux and macOS.  
One of the main benefits of Jenkins is that it is a well-known tool with lots of community support, there are many plugins available (including well-known names like Slack, GitHub, Docker, Build Pipeline + more), and the project is well-maintained by a large community of developers.
